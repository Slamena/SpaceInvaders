## **About**

---

First-course project. 2D Canvas HTML game made during the CORE Code School bootcamp.

Some aliens want to invade the earth. Don't let them go through your high trained defense. Use your lasers to destroy them and keep the earth safe.

### **Goal**

- Destroy as many aliens ship as you can.
- Keep the aliens away from the earth.
- The aliens will try to destroy you.

<br/>

### **Instructions**

-   Once you hit the start button some aliens are going to start showing from the top of the screen.

-   Use the controls below to destroy the aliens.

-   Each alien you destroy will give you 1 point.

-   If an alien crush against your space ship you will lose one life. You get to 0... game over.

-   Each alien that go through the window will deduct 2 points. You get to 0... game over.

Main controls for the player:

| Controls   |  Player  |
| ---------- | -------- |
| Move right | D        |
| Move left  | A        |
| Shoot      | Space    |

## **Motivation**

---

I got inspired by my love to games. I've been playing video games for a long time. I want to build a retro classic game with a different and unique style, so I made this.

I repeat, _NOT_ inspired by Cyberpunk 2077.

Just kidding.
