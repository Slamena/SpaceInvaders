## **âœ¦ About**

---

Mid-course project. 2D Canvas HTML game made during the CORE Code School bootcamp. It is a classic Pong game with a retro style and with the artistic trend of cyberpunk.

It is important to mention that the game is for play **_--- 1v1 ---_**. That means that is a local multiplayer game. Enjoy it!.

### **âœ¦ Goal**

---

-   Stay focus. You need to beat your opponent. Use the " player bar" to hit the ball while it bouncing through all the field.

-   There are some points spreaded int he field to make the game easier to win, if you catch the points of course, so grab it all.

-   Win the first player who get 10 points. Next the game will restart.

-   Play as much as you want.

<br/>

### **âœ¦ Instructions**

---

Input map for players control:

| Move       | Player 1 | Player 2 |
| ---------- | -------- | -------- |
| Begin game | Spacebar | Spacebar |
| Move up    | W        | I        |
| Move down  | S        | K        |

<br/>
<br/>

## **âœ¦ Motivation**

---

I got inspired by my love to games. I've been playing video games for a long time. I want to build a retro classic game with a different and unique style, so I made this.

I repeat, _NOT_ inspired by Cyberpunk 2077.

Just kidding.

## **âœ¦ Code Examples**

---

-   ### Ball Class:

This class represents a lot of the project. It was a really hard and important class to develop.

_Method "update" is nice to focus on, because you can see the ball bouncing effect code._

```ts
let var: number;
```
